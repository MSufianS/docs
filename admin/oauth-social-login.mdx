## Supported OAuth Providers

**Aleuto** comes with support for the following OAuth providers out of the box:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

You can enable/disable any of these providers by going to the Admin Panel and under "Settings" click on "Oauth Login Providers". You will be redirected to the social login settings page.

Here you can click on the social login provider you want to enable/disable, then use the toggle to enable/disable it.

Once you enable a provider, it will be shown automatically on the login/register page.

## Configuring Your OAuth Providers

You will also need to configure the credentials for each provider. To do that, while still on the social login settings page, click on the social login provider you want to configure, then click on **"Edit"**. You will be redirected to the social login provider credentials page.

Follow the instructions shown on the right-hand-side of the provider credentials page to get the credentials for the provider you want to configure.
