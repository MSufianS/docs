## Configuration

Click on "Lemon Squeezy" and using the toggle "is active" you can enable/disable the payment provider. (Don't forget to click "Save" after you make any changes).

Once you enable Lemon Squeezy, you will need to configure the credentials for it. To do that, click on the payment provider you want to configure, then click on "Edit credentials". You will be redirected to the payment provider credentials page.

You will need to copy some values from your Lemon Squeezy account to your application to be able to connect it. To do that please follow the following steps:

## Configuring Lemon Squeezy Plans & Products

Unfortunately, Lemon Squeezy doesn't offer an API that SaaSykit can use to automatically generate plans products for you just like it's the case with Stripe & Paddle. This means that you will need to manually create the plans and products in Lemon Squeezy and link them to your application.

First, create your subscription plans & products in the admin panel and setup their prices.

Once you are done with that, it's time to create your plans and products in Lemon Squeezy.

To do that, login to your Lemon Squeezy account and on the left menu, click on "Store" > "Products". Click on the "+ New Product" button on the right to create a new product.

If you are creating a subscription plan, you might need to create multiple variants to the same product. For example: if you have a "Pro" plan that is billed monthly and annually, you will need to create two variants for the same "Pro" product.

Just make sure that you choose "Subscription" for the pricing model and enter the price for the plan.
